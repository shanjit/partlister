partlister
==========

      The partlister is an Open-Source Ruby on Rails application 
      designed to help manage a electronic inventory.
      
      Created as a weekend project, the application uses 
      Twitter Bootstrap for its front-end design and the Rails
      framework for its backend.
      
      Initially created for managing the component inventory at the 
      Centre for Electronic Design and Technology, NSIT Lab, the 
      application is now open-sourced.
